Minnie and Mickey are getting ready to send out Holiday bonuses to their hard working employees in Retail District #5. The bonuses are calculated based on how much each retail store sold in each category. The retail store with the highest amount sold in a category will receive $5,000. The retail store with the lowest amount sold in a category will receive $1,000. All other retail stores in district #5 will receive $2,000. If a retail store didnâ€™t sale anything in a category, or they have a negative sales amount, they are not eligible for a bonus in that category. If only one retail store sold items in a category, they are eligible to receive only the bonus of $5000 for that category.
